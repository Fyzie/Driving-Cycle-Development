- K20 to N28 are the results of [Parameter_analysis.m](https://github.com/Fyzie/Driving-Cycle-Development/blob/main/final-progress/Parameter_analysis.m)
- H38 are the set of microtrips by [Feature_Extraction.m](https://github.com/Fyzie/Driving-Cycle-Development/blob/main/final-progress/Feature_Extraction.m)
- O20 are the feature extracted from microtrips by [Feature_Extraction.m](https://github.com/Fyzie/Driving-Cycle-Development/blob/main/final-progress/Feature_Extraction.m)
- R20 are the microtrip clusters including the minimum distance from its cluster center by [K_means.m](https://github.com/Fyzie/Driving-Cycle-Development/blob/main/final-progress/K_means.m)

## Sheets 6 and above are a collection of quick analyses as the project progresses
